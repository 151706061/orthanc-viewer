Orthanc Viewer
==============

This is the source code of a lightweight, native viewer of medical
images in the DICOM format. The viewer is built on the top of the REST
API of Orthanc, a DICOM server. It can display 3D images, and is able
to display nuclear medicine images (PET-CT fusion).

The original author of the code is Quentin Smetz, who developed this
viewer as a part of his Master's degree in computer science at the
University of Liège (Belgium). The code was subsequently packaged and
publicly released by Sébastien Jodogne as a part of the Orthanc
project.

This software is work-in-progress and is still experimental. It cannot
be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.


Requirements
------------

To build this software, the "Orthanc Client" library and development
headers must be installed. Official packages are notably available for
Fedora >= 18 (cf. "orthancclient-devel") and Debian >= Jessie
(cf. "liborthancclient-dev").

You will also need to install Qt, VTK and CMake.
