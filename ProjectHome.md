This repository contains the source code of a lightweight, native viewer of medical images in the DICOM format. The viewer is built on the top of the REST API of [Orthanc](http://www.orthanc-server.com/), a DICOM server. It can display 3D images, and is able to display nuclear medicine images (PET-CT fusion).

The original author of the code is [Quentin Smetz](mailto:qsmetz@gmail.com), who developed this viewer as a part of his Master's degree in computer science at the University of Liège (Belgium). The code was subsequently packaged and publicly released by [Sébastien Jodogne](mailto:s.jodogne@gmail.com) as a part of the Orthanc project.

This software is work-in-progress and is still experimental. It cannot be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
